# Open Source Sustainability

You started off building something to solve a problem you had and wanted to share it for others that also have that problem.

Before you know it your project is popular, people are downloading it from a package registry, they are finding bugs, requesting features and hopefully submitting fixes.

But now it's gone from something that you did in your spare time to something you're constantly thinking about. And this is where you start wondering how much longer can you keep it up.

Geoff has had a long history in Open Source and is involved in large projects such as ReactiveUI. Come and learn from his experience about what it takes to be a maintainer, but also what it takes to be a good consumer of Open Source to ensure sustainability.
